aptly (1.3.0+ds1-2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version tries to fix the database backwards compatibility,
  so you don't need to rebuild the database if you upgrade from
  aptly <= 1.3.0-6.

  However some fields are missing, like created time of a snapshot.

aptly (1.3.0+ds1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The database created by aptly <= 1.3.0-6 is not compatible
    with greater versions. Users must create a new database.
    The `aptly db recover` will not fix the issue.
